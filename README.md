# Document-Similarity

In this project I am finding the similarity between words using cosine similarity method 

for example if input is provided as india->dehli than what japan->?
than our output should be tokyo

we are actually providing three words in input i.e(india,dehli,japan)



To measure how similar two words are, we need a way to measure the degree of similarity between two embedding vectors for the two words by using cosine similarity and for this project i am using 50 dimensional GloVe vector as word vector initially. GloVe vectors provide much more useful information about the meaning of individual words.
